/*Write a program that safely compares 
two floating-point numbers (double) with precision eps = 0.000001.
Note: Two floating-point numbers a and b cannot be compared directly
by a == b because of the nature of the floating-point arithmetic. 
Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal if they are more closely
to each other than a fixed constant eps.
