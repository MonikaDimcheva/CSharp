    The only input line will contain one integer number-the score
Output
    Output the score with the applied bonus
1.If the score is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10.
2.If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100.
3.If the score is between 7 and 9, the program multiplies it by 1000.
4.If the score is less than 0 or more than 9, 
the program prints "invalid score".
